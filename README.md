### In its quest to challenge Space X, the new rocket company, Space Y, tasked its data science team with the following objectives:
#### 1- Gather information about Space X
#### 2- Determine the pricing for each launch
#### 3- Create dashboards to visually present key insights
#### 4- Train a machine learning model to predict whether Space X will reuse the first stage

### Summary of Methodologies:
#### 1- Data Collection with API And Web Scraping
#### 2- Data Wrangling
#### 3- Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL
#### 4- Exploratory Data Analysis with Data Visualization
#### 5- Interactive Visual Analytics with Folium
#### 6- Machine Learning Prediction

### Results:
#### 1-The launch success rate has been progressively improving over the years
#### 2-Factors to consider when selecting a launch site include its proximity to the Equator and its location near the coastline
#### 3-The KSC LC-39A is the optimal launch site, boasting the highest success rate of approximately 80% for successful launches across payloads of various masses
#### 4-The ISS orbit is recommended due to its history of successful launches across various payload masses. The choice of other orbits depends on the payload mass. For payloads weighing over 8000 kg, consider utilizing the ISS, PO, and VLEO orbits. For payloads under 8000 kg, it is advisable to use the LEO, GTO, and SSO orbits
#### 5-The four machine learning models exhibited similar performance
